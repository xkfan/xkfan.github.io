In other (**e.g.,** C) programs, ...

A serial loop that computes the remaining N%VF iterations is also
added for the case that N does not **evenly divide by** VF.

Finally, the loop bound is transformed to reflect the new number of iterations,
**and if necessary**,
an epilog scalar loop is created to handle cases of loop bounds which
**do not divide by** the vectorization factor.

Using a standard loop-based vectorization scheme for SIMD,
multiple occurences of the same operation across consecutive iterations can be
grouped into single SIMD instructions, as shown in Figure 2,
where VF is the vectorization factor - the number of elements
that **fit in** a vector register.
(**We assume for clarity that** len **is divisible by**
VF).

An
**equation of state (hereinafter EOS)**
which relates the pressure and density fields must be imposed.

**For the sake of clarity** a cut-off limit of 2h
**will be considered from now on**.

Autovectorizaiton is a **mature research area**;
automatic detection of vector loops in serial code

## Short Phrases

We also present **preliminary results** and future work.

The performance of these applications can be **considerably increased**.

Some **nontrivial** issues and choices.

These mechanisms (packing and unpacking data elements in and out of
vector registers and special permute instructions) are not easy to use,
and **incur considerable penalties**.

Accessing a block of memory from a location which is not aligned on a natural
vector size boundary is often **prohibited** or
**bears a heavy performance penalty**.

Other platforms (MMX, SSE, MIPS, IA-64 and SPE) either have instructions
to merge the high and low parts of two vectors, or something **akin to**
the AltiVec vperm, but accepts only an immediate constant in
the instruction.

**To complicate things further**,
none of the previously described techniques of Sections
3.1 and 3.2 can transform the graphs into fully
isomorphic.

**To make matters worse**,
the existing reordering fails when the code contains multiple
commutative operations of the same type chained
together.

**It is worth noting that**,
although alignment and aliasing were discussed by Maleki in [xxx],
it was not fully explored in their paper.


The
programming paradigm
popularly known as object-oriented programming (OOP)
is widely used for developing large and complex applications
because it
**encapsulates**
the implementation details of data structures and
algorithms into objects;
this
**in turn**
**facilitates**
cleaner
software design, better code reuse, and easier software maintenance.

Code size is
**an increasing concern on**
resource constrained systems,
**ranging from**
embedded devices
**to**
cloud servers.
To **address** the issue,
lowering memory occupancy has become a
**priority in**
developing and deploying applications,
and
**accordingly** compiler-based optimizations have been proposed to reduce program footprint.
However,
**prior arts** are generally dealing with source codes or intermediate representations,
and thus are very limited in scope in real scenarios where only binary files are commonly provided.
**To fill the gap**,
this paper presents a
**novel** code-size optimization RollBin to reroll loops at binary level.
RollBin first locates the unrolled loops in binary files,
and then
**probes** to decide the unrolling factor by identifying regular memory address patterns.
To reconstruct the iterations,
we propose a customized data dependency analysis that
**tackles**
the challenges
brought by shuffled instructions and loop-carry dependencies.
Next, the recognized iterations are rolled up through instruction removal and update,
which are generally reverting the normal unrolling procedure.
The evaluations on standard SPEC2006/2017
and MiBench demonstrate that RollBin effectively shrinks code size
by 1.7\% and 2.2\% on average (up to 7.8\%),
which respectively
**outperforms the state-of-the-arts by** 31\% and 38\%
**In addition**,
the use cases of representative realistic applications
**manifest** that RollBin
**can be applicable in practices**.

It is useful in applications with nested parallelism,
particularly where the amount of nested parallelism is irregular and cannot
**be predicted beforehand**.
However,
**prior works** have shown that dynamic parallelism may
**impose a high performance penalty**
when a large number of small grids are launched.
The large number of launches results in high launch latency due to congestion,
and the small grid sizes result in
**hardware underutilization**.

**Several** compiler
**works** involve direct outer-loop vectorization, include ...

Heterogeneous Systems offer
**tremendous** opportunities through hardware innovation,
but this leaves a lot unanswered in regards to ‘how will we program them.’
SYCL is a
**Khronos** standard to extend C++ for Heterogeneous Programming,
and is instructive to review
**in terms of**
the practical problems inherent in extending programming
for heterogeneous systems.

However,
this approach is limited because
dynamic\_cast only
supports polymorphic classes,
**whereas**
static\_cast
is used for both polymorphic and non-polymorphic classes.

... making the technique more
**viable for practical adoption**.

One approach to get good accuracy is to modify the representation of pointers
to **associate** the pointer **with** information on the bounds of the
underlying object.

In principle, bounds check instrumentation eliminates the problem,
but this introduces high overheads and **is further hampered by**
limited compatibility against un-instrumented code.

To address this problem,
we present an extension of low-fat pointers to stack objects by using
a collection of techniques,
such as pointer mirroring and memory aliasing,
**thereby**
allowing stack objects to
**enjoy bounds error protection from**
instrumented code.

Although memory errors **have been well researched with numerous proposed solutions**,
the threat **nevertheless persists**.

Low runtime performance overheads are important
(and in general the lower the better),
however the impact is **application dependent**.
For example,
the AddressSanitizer-hardened Tor browser is an example application
where security **is prioritized over** performance.

Now all eyes are on how they will help shape policy as the Chinese economy
**navigates a growing array of challenges, including**
 sluggish consumption,
rising unemployment,
a downturn in the housing market,
lack of business confidence,
local governments' debt distress,
an ageing population
and increasing tension with the United States over technology sanctions.

It's not clear if Iran has successfully reverse-engineered any US weapons
taken in Ukraine,
but Tehran
**has proven highly adept at**
developing weapons systems based on US equipment seized in the past.

In the hands of Iran's proxies,
these weapons
**pose a real threat to**
Israel's conventional military forces.

The FDIC,
an independent government agency that insures bank deposits
and oversees financial institutions,
said all insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits
**by no later than**
Monday morning.

**The wheels started to come off** on Wednesday,
when SBV announced it had sold a bunch of securities at a loss and
that it would sell $2.25 billion in new shares to shore up its balance sheet.

Silicon Valley Bank’s decline
**stems partly from**
the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes over the past year.

Higher rates hit tech especially hard,
undercutting the value of tech stocks and making it tough to raise funds,
Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said.
That
**prompted**
many tech firms
**to**
draw down the deposits they held at SVB to fund their operations.

We have already seen that when memory accesses miss the caches the costs
**skyrocket**.

**As soon as**
the L1d is
**not sufficient anymore**
the performance goes down
**dramatically**
to less than 6 bytes per cycle.

The step at $2^{18}$ bytes is due to the
**exhaustion**
of the DTLB cache which means additional work for each new page.

**What is more astonishing**
than the read performance is the write and copy performance.

This does not mean the Core 2 processors perform poorly.
**To the contrary,**
their performance is always better than the Netburst core’s.

Such a system structure has a number of
**noteworthy**
consequences:

The read performance throughout the working set range
**hovers around**
the optimal 16 bytes per cycle.

On Tuesday,
OpenAI announced the next-generation version of
the artificial intelligence technology that
**underpins**
its viral chatbot tool, ChatGPT.
The more powerful GPT-4 promises to
**blow**
previous iterations
**out of the water**,
potentially changing the way we use the internet to work,
play and create.
But it could also add to challenging questions around
how AI tools can upend professions,
enable students to cheat,
and shift our relationship with technology.

It is now available via a waitlist and has already
**made its way into**
some third-party products,
including Microsoft’s new AI-powered Bing search engine.
Some users with early access to the tool are sharing their experiences and
**highlighting**
some of its most
**compelling**
use cases.

With just a few days to go until the Federal Reserve’s
next interest rate decision,
US policymakers are sitting
**between a rock and a hard place**.

So far,
Xi has been helping Putin by sticking to a delicate balancing act:
refusing to publicly condemn Putin’s war
and blaming the West for “provoking” Russia,
while strengthening economic ties but
**stopping short of**
providing “lethal” military aid to Moscow.

Evaluated with 10 representative DNN models widely adopted in various domains,
Cloudblazer i20
**outperforms**
Nvidia T4 and A10 GPUs
**with a geometric mean of**
2.22x and 1.16x in performance and 1.04x and 1.17x in energy efficiency, respectively.

Thus,
**now more than ever**,
it is essential to
**maximally utilize a CPU’s hardware resources**
to
**squeeze out every last drop of single thread performance**.

Many prior compiler **works** [xxx] have
**demonstrated the efficacy**

**In the absence of**
DLP,
only floating point computations are performed in the vector pipeline
as the general purpose register file is not connected to floating point units.

## Long Sentences

**Owing to**
their flexibility in the resolution of simulation domain geometries,
**they (particle methods) are regarded as superior to**
 grid-based methods
**if it comes to**
complex geometries or moving boundary problems.

**However, as usual nothing is for free,**
particles methods
**come with some disadvantages that do not apply to**
grid-based methods.

**Although**
many models capable of simulating such flows
**have been reported in the literature**,
particle methods such as SPH
**are arguably the most appealing conceptually and intuitively**.

As a fully Lagrangian meshless method, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
**has been successfully applied to various free surface problems such as**
dam-break flow, breaking waves on beach, rigid body drop,
and flow in sloshing tank, etc.
**However, there are drawbacks inherent to**
SPH
**such as**
an artificial stress term required to avoid tensile instability.
**Additionally**,
boundary deficiency artifacts remain problematic where particle field
variables near the boundaries lose consistency resulting from the lack
of influence of the neighboring particles in a support domain truncated
by the boundaries.

Vectorization, when applied automatically by a compiler,
is referred to as autovectorization.
In this paper,
**we use the two terms interchangeably to refer to**
compiler vectorization.

Vectorization techniques that exploit this type of parallelism,
such as [xx],
**could be used as a complementary approach**
to loop-based vectorization.

**Attention must also be paid to** existing GCC operations and conventions.

When introducing a new operation, a natural desire is to use
**as general an abstraction as possible**.

As demonstrated below, SIMD alignment mechanisms
**vary greatly from platform to platform**,
but there is also a lot of commonality between groups of platforms.

**Particularly**,
constructor inlining-or worse exclusion-due to optimization
**render** class inheritance recovery **challenging**.


However, the
**performance benefit of** static\_cast
**comes with a security risk**
because information at compile time is
**by no means** sufficient to fully verify the safety of type conversions.

(In contributions).
While evaluating CAVER,
we discovered eleven previously unknown bad-casting vulnerabilities in two
mature and widely-used open source projects, GNU libstdc++ and Firefox.
All vulnerabilities have been reported and fixed in these
projects’ latest releases.
**We expect that integration with**
unit tests and fuzzing infrastructure
**will allow CAVER to**
discover more bad-casting vulnerabilities
**in the future**.

**Given the well understood nature of** buffer overflow
**and the numerous proposed solutions**,
**it is reasonable to ask why protection mechanisms**
that prevent buffer overflow **are not in widespread use**.
**There are a number of barriers to adoption that have been identified, including:**
