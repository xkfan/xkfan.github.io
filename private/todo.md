## code version of slp for VAL SIMD Architecture

Targeting CGO'24 / ICPP'25 / PACT'25

Implement in LLVM

Both with loop vectorization enabled & disabled.

SVE (Gem5 simulation)

RISCV V (sg2042): needs to check if the tool for traslating v1.0 to v0.7.1 is available.

## partial slp in sve

## loop split flatten

## libm

sic/cos/exp/log etc.

## SIMD of lbm on VLA architecture

## strcmp\_sve on VLA architecture

## stencil on riscv-v

ICPP'24

evaluation on sg2042.

Refer to the paper of stencil on SVE.
